# MooseX::FileAttribute

This is the repository for
the
[CPAN module `File::Attribute`](https://metacpan.org/release/MooseX-FileAttribute). It
is part of the [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose) set of plugins,
and it allows to easily deal with instance variables that contain file
or directory paths, adding the `has_file` and `has_directory`
attributes to the Moose set of variables.
